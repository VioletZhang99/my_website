# 1. Climate change and temperature anomalies 

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies, we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

We run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

We have two objectives in this section:

1. We select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. 

1. We convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. We name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(-c("J-D","D-N","DJF","MAM","JJA","SON")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(2:13,
               names_to = "Month",
               values_to = "delta")
```

We inspect our dataframe. It has three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## 1.1. Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```
We use facet_wrap to see the weather anomalies by month of the year. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
tidyweather$Month = factor(tidyweather$Month, levels=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul",
                                                       "Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Month) +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )
```

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. 


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. 

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE))

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## 1.2. Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

We construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. 

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  filter(year >= 2011) %>%
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            SD_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            count_delta = n()) %>% 
  mutate(SE_delta = SD_delta/sqrt(count_delta),
         lower_CI = mean_delta-2*SE_delta,
         upper_CI = mean_delta+2*SE_delta)

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
set.seed(1234)

boot_weather <- comparison %>%
  # Choose only  Animation films
  filter(year >= 2011) %>%
  
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the median of each sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")

percentile_ci <- boot_weather %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci
```

The data shows us that from 2011 till present, the mean variation from expected temperature is positive 1.06 degree, the standard deviation is 0.276 and there are a total of 132 observations. With bootstrap, we generate a thousand sample means, each calculated with 132 observations extracted with replacement from our dataset, and get a new distribution representing the distribution of the population mean. With 95% confidence, we can say that the true population mean lays in the interval [1.01, 1.11].

# 2. General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.

We analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable", "NA"))
```

We create 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## 2.1. Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

We estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016.

1. We create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. 

```{r}
gss <- gss %>%  
  mutate(snap_insta = ifelse(snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm =="Yes", "Yes", "No"))
```

1. We calculate the proportion of Yesâ€™s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.

```{r}
gss %>% 
  select(snap_insta) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>%
  summarise(count_snap_insta = count(snap_insta)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = snap_insta, values_from = count_snap_insta) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = Yes/(No+Yes))
```

1. Using the CI formula for proportions, we construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
sex_snap_insta<-gss %>% 
  filter(snap_insta=="Yes") %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(count_sex = count(sex))%>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = count_sex) %>% 
  mutate(count_all=Female+Male,Male_rate = Male/(Male+Female),
         Female_rate=1-Male_rate)
sex_snap_insta
```

```{r}
#proportion test for Male
prop.test(192,514)
#proportion test for Female
prop.test(322,514)
```

## 2.2. Twitter, by education level

We estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. We turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. 
```{r}
gss$degree=factor(gss$degree,levels=c("Lt high school","High School","Junior college","Bachelor","Graduate"))
```

1. We create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. 

```{r}
gss<-gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate=ifelse(degree=="Bachelor"|degree=="Graduate","yes","no"))
```

1. We calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r}

prop_twitter_yes<-gss %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate=="yes") %>% 
  select(twitter) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  summarize(yes_twitter_rate=count(twitter=="Yes")/n(),
            no_twitter_rate=count(twitter=="No")/n())
prop_twitter_yes
```
```{r}
prop_twitter_yes<-gss %>% 
  group_by(bachelor_graduate) %>% 
  select(twitter) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  summarize(yes_twitter=count(twitter=="Yes"),
            no_twitter=count(twitter=="No"),
            count_all=yes_twitter+no_twitter,
            yes_twitter_rate=count(twitter=="Yes")/n(),
            no_twitter_rate=count(twitter=="No")/n())
prop_twitter_yes
```

1. Using the CI formula for proportions, we construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r,bachelor_graduate_yes}
prop.test(114,489)
```

```{r,bachelor_graduate_no}
prop.test(30,203)

```

We note that these two confidence intervals overlap.

## 2.3. Email usage

Laslty, we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly.

1. We create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.


```{r}

gss<-gss %>% 
  mutate(email=emailmin+emailhr*60)
head(gss)
```



1. We visualise the distribution of this new variable. We find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. 


```{r}
gss %>% 
  select(email) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=email))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20)

gss_email<-gss %>% 
  select(email) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  summarize(mean_email=mean(email),
            median_email=median(email))
gss_email
```

The histogram shows that the minutes Americans spend on email is right-skewed. In this case, the median will be a better measure of the minutes Americans spend on email than the mean.


1. Using the `infer` package, we calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

boot_active2 <- gss  %>%
  select(email) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = email) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the median of each sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")

percentile_ci <- boot_active2 %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci
```
The lower CI is 6 hours 25 minutes, the upper CI is 7 hours 33 minutes. 


1. Do we expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? 
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
boot_active3 <- gss  %>%
  select(email) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = email) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the median of each sample
  calculate(stat = "mean")

percentile_ci <- boot_active3 %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci
```

A 99% confidence interval will be wider, as we are more confident (compared to 95% confident) that the mean will locate in this interval, the interval should be wider.


# 3. Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 


glimpse(approval_polllist) 

library(lubridate) 

clean_approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(enddate=mdy(enddate),
         week=isoweek(enddate)) 

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## 3.1. Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r}
clean_approval_polllist <- clean_approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Adults") %>%
  mutate(daily_approval_margin = approve - disapprove)
```


```{r}

weekly_avg_app_rates <- clean_approval_polllist %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize( mean_weekly_approval_margin = mean(daily_approval_margin, na.rm = TRUE),
             number_polls = n(),
             std_weekly_approval_margin = STDEV(daily_approval_margin)) %>%

  mutate(lower_bound_CI_app_rate = mean_weekly_approval_margin - qt(0.975, df=number_polls-1)*std_weekly_approval_margin/sqrt(number_polls),
         upper_bound_CI_app_rate = mean_weekly_approval_margin + qt(0.975, df=number_polls-1)*std_weekly_approval_margin/sqrt(number_polls))
         
```

```{r}
qt(0.975,6)
```


```{r}
ggplot(weekly_avg_app_rates, aes(x=week)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=mean_weekly_approval_margin, color="red")) +
  geom_line( aes(y=mean_weekly_approval_margin, color="red")) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound_CI_app_rate, 
                 ymax = upper_bound_CI_app_rate), 
                 show.legend = NA,
                 fill = "grey",
                 colour = "orange", 
                 alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y= mean_weekly_approval_margin), fill=NA)+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="orange", size=3)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## 3.2. Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.


# 4. Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, we will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, we will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

We have to use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

We have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. We may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). 

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? We generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report our results. 

```{r}
skim(hiv)
```

```{r}
life_expectency_long <- life_expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(2:302, values_to = "life_expec" , names_to = "year")

hiv_long <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(2:34, values_to = "prop_hiv" , names_to = "year")

life_hiv <- right_join(hiv_long, life_expectency_long, by = c("year" = "year", "country" = "country"))

life_hiv$year = as.numeric(life_hiv$year)

life_hiv_bank_data <- left_join(life_hiv, worldbank_data, by = c("year" = "date", "country" = "country"))

life_hiv_bank_data <- life_hiv_bank_data %>%
  rename(fertilityRate = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN, gdp = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, mortalityRate = SH.DYN.MORT, primarySchoolEnrolment = SE.PRM.NENR)

```

We used a mixture of both right and left joins because so long as the dataframes are in the correct order when passed through the function, it does not matter whether you do a right or left join. We did not use an inner join as that would have resulted in data loss - the HIV dataframe only has values from the year 1979 onwards whereas the life expectancy dataframe has values from the year 1800 onwards.

```{r}
life_hiv_bank_data_region <- right_join( life_hiv_bank_data ,countries, by = c( "country" = "country")) %>%
  select(year, country, region,fertilityRate, gdp, mortalityRate, primarySchoolEnrolment, prop_hiv,life_expec )
```


1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? We generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
```{r}
ggplot(life_hiv_bank_data_region, aes(x=prop_hiv, y=life_expec )) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  ylim(30,100) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula= y~x) +
  labs( title = "Relationship HIV prevalence and life expectancy ", y = "Life Expectency", x = "Proportion of HIV prevalance ")
```

As we can see from the above plot, as the proportion of HIV prevalence increases, the life expectancy decreases. Thus, there is a negative relationship between the two variables.

1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? We generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report our results. 

```{r}
ggplot(life_hiv_bank_data_region, aes(x=fertilityRate , y=gdp )) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
#  ylim(30,100) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula= y~x) +
  facet_wrap(~region) +
  labs( title = "Relationship fertility rate and GDP per capita ", y = "GDP per capita", x = "Fertility rate ")

```

As GDP increases, the fertility rate decreases. 

1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? We generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

```{r}
NA_count <- life_hiv_bank_data_region %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  filter(is.na(prop_hiv)) %>%
  summarise(countNA = n())
```

```{r}
ggplot(NA_count,aes( y = fct_reorder(region, countNA), x = countNA)) +
  geom_col()
```

Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe & Central Asia have the most missing observations for HIV data.


1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, we find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

```{r}

mortality_diff <- life_hiv_bank_data_region %>%
  filter(year == 1800 | year == 2021 ) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate( region = region, 
          country = country, 
          life_expec = life_expec) %>%
  select(region, country, life_expec) %>%
  pivot_wider( names_from = year, values_from = life_expec) %>%
  rename("year_1800" = "1800", "year_2021"= "2021") %>%
  mutate(change_mortality = (year_2021 - year_1800) )

```

```{r}
mortality_top5 <- mortality_diff %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = change_mortality, n=5)

mortality_top5

mortality_least5 <- mortality_diff %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = -change_mortality, n=5)

mortality_least5
```

We can see that each region has seen various changes in mortality rate over the years.

1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

```{r}
ggplot(life_hiv_bank_data_region, aes(x=primarySchoolEnrolment, y=fertilityRate)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x)
```

```{r}
 life_hiv_bank_data_region %>%
  select(fertilityRate, primarySchoolEnrolment) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  cor()
```

As we can see from the scatter plot, there is a strong negative relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate. We can see that as primary school enrollment increases, the fertility rate decreases. This is further supported by the correlation between the two variables. The correlation in question is -0.727 which is quite significant negative correlation.

# 5. Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

We can see that in the month of May and June 2020, bike rentals went down immensely, compared to previous years. This can be attributed to the national lockdowns that were enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic during that time.

We will recreate the following graph:

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
 general_monthly_average <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016 & year<=2019) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(general_monthly_average = mean(bikes_hired))

monthly_average <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_average = mean(bikes_hired),
            year = unique(year))

full_monthly_averages <- left_join(monthly_average, general_monthly_average, by="month")

full_monthly_averages %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=month, group=1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=monthly_average)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=general_monthly_average),
            color = "blue",
            size=0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(general_monthly_average > monthly_average, general_monthly_average, monthly_average), 
                  ymax = general_monthly_average), 
              fill = "palegreen3", 
              alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(general_monthly_average <= monthly_average, general_monthly_average, monthly_average), 
                  ymax = general_monthly_average), 
              fill = "lightcoral", alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  labs(title = "Monthly changes if Tfl bike rentals",
       subtitle="Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2026-2019",
       y = "Bike rentals",
       x = "Months"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)
    ) +
  NULL

```
  
The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
expected_bike_pw <- bike %>%
  filter(day >= as.Date("2016-1-1") & day <= as.Date("2019-12-31")) %>%
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rentals = mean(bikes_hired))

bike_pw <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2016 & !(year == 2021 & week > 30)) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rentals = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  left_join(expected_bike_pw, by="week") %>% 
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals,
         excess_rentals_inpct = excess_rentals/expected_rentals)
```


```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
weekly_plot <- bike_pw %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = excess_rentals_inpct), 
            color = "black", 
            size = 0.1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(excess_rentals_inpct > 0, 0, excess_rentals_inpct), 
                  ymax = excess_rentals_inpct),
              fill = "green4", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ifelse(excess_rentals_inpct > 0, excess_rentals_inpct, 0), 
                  ymax = excess_rentals_inpct),
              fill = "red", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_rug(color = ifelse(bike_pw$excess_rentals_inpct > 0 , "green", "red"),
           alpha = 0.5,
           size = 0.3) +
  annotate("rect",xmin = 13, xmax = 26, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = "grey", alpha = 0.3) +
  annotate("rect",xmin = 39, xmax = 53, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = "grey", alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13,53,by=13)) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=7, face="bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6, face="bold"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=5, face="bold"),
        strip.text = element_text(size=5),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=5),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size=0.1),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size=0.1)) +
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals", 
       subtitle = "% change from weekly averages \n calculated between 2016-2019",
       y = "", 
       x = "week",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store") 
weekly_plot

```

For both of these graphs, we to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, we see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Note: We can see massive spikes in the previous graph, so it might be more useful to use the median rather than the mean, as extreme values won't affect it as much.
