Hi! This is Chuhan Zhang and you can call my English name Violet!

I came from Xiamen, China, a beautiful small island with perfect climate.

I graduated from Renmin University of China, with double bachelor degrees in English Langauge and Finance. Now, I am reading my Master in Analytics and Management in London Business School. 

During college, I have completed many projects and internships relatad to data anlaytics, which ignited my interest of a data-driven career. 

I have worked at ByteDance as a product analytics intern, presenting my product design suggestions based on data analytics. Working within an insider business strategy team in Intel Corporation, I built a word segmentation model with Python to detect the Intel-related orders, helping the strategy team discover new business opportunities. 

Standing on a new start for my first career exploration, I would like to seek job opportunities in consulting and technology industry, leveraging data analytics to change the future business world.
